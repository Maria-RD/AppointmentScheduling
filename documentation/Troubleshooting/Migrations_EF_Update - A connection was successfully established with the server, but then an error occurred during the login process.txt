A connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred during the login process. (provider SSL Provider, error 0 - The certificate chain was issued by an authority that is not trusted.)

Put the connection string in this way:
Server=MyServerName;Database=MyDbName;Trusted_Connection=SSPI;Encrypt=false;TrustServerCertificate=true
